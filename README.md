# SwiftGPTWeb
Trying to make a GPT bot that can search the web in swift, without any luck, tried it all, any suggestions is appreciated.

it has web scraping functionalities, web search functionalities, and gpt access all you have to do is replacing the google search api and the openai api key 

the UI is simple, but thats where you communicate with the bot
